Battleship Console Game Project (January 2023) - An Assignment from Georgia Tech's Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I: Foundations and Syntax Basics Course

My implementation of the classic Battleship game, developed as an assignment for the edx Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I course back in January. 

Project Features:
- Players can place their ships on a 5x5 grid by entering coordinates.
- Players take turns firing at each other's grids to sink opponent ships.
- The game displays the boards, tracks hits and misses, and announces the winner.

Though the code may be simple and have room for improvement as it's one of my first Java projects, it reflects my early efforts to learn and grow as a Java developer.
Feel free to explore the code and try out the game yourself!
